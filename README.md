My Practice Work for KaggleXGoogle AI Agents Intensive Course Assignment 2b
🧠 Exercise : Build an agent that generates images using the MCP server, but requires approval for "bulk" image generation:

Single image request (1 image): Auto-approve, generate immediately

Bulk request (>1 image): Pause and ask for approval before generating multiple images

I have simulated an AI agent that generates images (using a mock MCP server) with auto-approval for single-image requests and user approval for bulk requests, focusing on workflow and cost management without accessing a real MCP server.
